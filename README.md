# web-dev-projects
This repository showcases two of my web development projects: a sleek single-page portfolio website 🌐 and a practical expense tracker application 💸. Both projects demonstrate my skills in front-end development, design, and functionality. Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute to these projects! 🤝
